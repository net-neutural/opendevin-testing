# Hacker News Top Story Extractor

This repository contains a bash script (`top_hn_story.sh`) that attempts to extract the title, link, and points of the top story on Hacker News.

## Usage

```bash
chmod +x top_hn_story.sh
./top_hn_story.sh
```

## Current Status

The script is currently not working reliably.  It successfully downloads the Hacker News homepage but struggles to correctly parse and extract the title, link, and points of the top story.  Further investigation and debugging are needed.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the script's reliability are welcome. Please open an issue or pull request with your proposed changes.
